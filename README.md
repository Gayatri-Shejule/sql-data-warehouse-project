# sql-data-warehouse-project
Building a modern data warehouse with SQL Server,including ETL processes,data modeling,and analytics.

📊 Data Warehouse Project
📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the end-to-end design and implementation of a Data Warehouse using industry-standard data engineering practices.
It focuses on transforming raw operational data into a structured, analytics-ready format to support business intelligence and decision-making.
The project simulates a real-world business scenario involving sales, customers, products, and time-based analysis.

🎯 Objectives
Design a scalable Data Warehouse architecture
Build an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline
Implement Dimensional Modeling (Star Schema)
Enable fast and efficient analytical reporting
Practice real-world SQL and data engineering concepts

🏗️ Data Warehouse Architecture
The project follows a three-layer architecture:
Source Systems → Staging Layer → Data Warehouse → Analytics

🔄 ETL Process
1️⃣ Extract
Data extracted from source systems
Loaded into staging tables

2️⃣ Transform
Data validation and cleaning
Handling missing values
Data type conversion
Surrogate key creation
Business logic implementation

3️⃣ Load
Dimension tables loaded first
Fact table populated with foreign keys
Ensures data integrity and consistency
